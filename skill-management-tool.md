Manage skills (create, update, delete). Skills are your procedural memory — reusable approaches for recurring task types. New skills go to ~/.hermes/skills/; existing skills can be modified wherever they live.

Actions: create (full SKILL.md + optional category), patch (old_string/new_string — preferred for fixes), edit (full SKILL.md rewrite — major overhauls only), delete, write_file, remove_file.

On delete, pass `absorbed_into=<umbrella>` when you're merging this skill's content into another one, or `absorbed_into=""` when you're pruning it with no forwarding target. This lets the curator tell consolidation from pruning without guessing, so downstream consumers (cron jobs that reference the old skill name, etc.) get updated correctly. The target you name in `absorbed_into` must already exist — create/patch the umbrella first, then delete.

Create when: complex task succeeded (5+ calls), errors overcome, user-corrected approach worked, non-trivial workflow discovered, or user asks you to remember a procedure.
Update when: instructions stale/wrong, OS-specific failures, missing steps or pitfalls found during use. If you used a skill and hit issues not covered by it, patch it immediately.

After difficult/iterative tasks, offer to save as a skill. Skip for simple one-offs. Confirm with user before creating/deleting.

Good skills: trigger conditions, numbered steps with exact commands, pitfalls section, verification steps. Use skill_view() to see format examples.

Pinned skills are protected from deletion only — skill_manage(action='delete') will refuse with a message pointing the user to `hermes curator unpin <name>`. Patches and edits go through on pinned skills so you can still improve them as pitfalls come up; pin only guards against irrecoverable loss.
